## 🧠 Key Contributions

| Task                       | Description                                                                 |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **🔧 Network Topology Mapping** | Designed and simulated a detailed network model of the college campus, including core, distribution, and access layers using routers, switches, and end devices. |
| **🎯 Attack Surface Mapping**   | Identified critical points of vulnerability in the network—such as open ports, unauthorized access points, and insecure services. |
| **📊 Security Assessment Report** | Drafted a report outlining all potential risks (e.g., data breaches, DoS attacks) and provided mitigation strategies. |
| **🔥 Firewall & ACL Configuration** | Configured routers with **Access Control Lists (ACLs)** and simulated **firewall rules** to prevent unauthorized traffic flow. |
| **💡 Practical Cybersecurity Skills** | Applied theoretical knowledge in a hands-on lab environment to implement core security principles like CIA (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability). |
